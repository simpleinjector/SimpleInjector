## Write a great title
Write a title that summarizes the specific problem, question, or feature request. Your title should be specific. If you have trouble coming up with a title, consider writing the title last. Here are some examples of good and bad titles:

Bad titles:
* Simple Injector Confusion
* How to get container instance
* sitecore upgrade issue with Simple Injector

Good titles:
* How to prevent Simple Injector from resolving generated ASP.NET Core TagHelper classes?
* Singletons are caching ThreadAbortExceptions, requiring the application to be restarted
* Can the ASP.NET Core integration cross-wiring feature work the other way around?

## Describe the bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

## Expected behavior
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

## Actual behavior
A clear and concise description. Additionally, a complete stack trace including all exception details of the exception and all inner exceptions if an exception is thrown.

## To Reproduce
Please provide a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example that reproduces the problem. (see: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) 

## Additional context
Add any other context about the problem here. e.g.:
* Library versions (version of Simple Injector and all affected integration packages). Don't say you're using the "latest" versions, but please state the actual version numbers. Depending on when someone reads it, it might not be the latest anymore and also you might think you're on the latest version when you aren't.
* .NET version
* Used libraries or frameworks (with version) that are required

## Important
* Do *not* include screen shots of code or exceptions. (see: https://idownvotedbecau.se/imageofcode and https://idownvotedbecau.se/imageofanexception/)
* Do ensure that code listing don't have a line width that exceeds 100 characters, as that would cause horizontal scrollbars, which make it harder to view the code.
* Follow the guidelines given by Stack Overflow and https://idownvotedbecau.se/.
