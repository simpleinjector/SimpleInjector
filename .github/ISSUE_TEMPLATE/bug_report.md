* Library versions (version of Simple Injector and all affected integration packages)
* .NET version
*Used libraries or frameworks (with version) that are required

**Important**
* Do *not* include screen shots of [code](https://idownvotedbecau.se/imageofcode) or [exceptions](https://idownvotedbecau.se/imageofanexception/).
