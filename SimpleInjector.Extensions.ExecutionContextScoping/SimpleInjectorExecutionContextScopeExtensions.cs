// Compared to the other lifestyles, this extensions class is NOT placed in the root namespace. Other
// lifestyles, such as the WebApiRequestLifestyle will use the ExecutionContextScopingLifestyle and users are
// expected to use these lifestyles and their extension methods, because this is much clearer. By not placing
// this class in the root namespace, we prevent the Container from being cluttered with methods that the user
// is not expected to use under normal conditions.
