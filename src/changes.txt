		-[Mvc] SimpleInjectorMvcExtensions.RegisterMvcAttributeFilterProvider has been marked obsolete. 
		 (work item 20946)

	Bug fixes:
		-[Mvc] Prevented RegisterMvcAttributeFilterProvider from being called multiple times. (work item 20960)


Version 2.5.2 (v2.5.2 RTM) 2014-07-13

	New features:
		-[Core] ContainerOptions.EnableDynamicAssemblyCompilation property has been added that can be used
		 to prevent the container from doing dynamic assembly compilation, such as the issues related to
		 work item 20677.

	Bug fixes:
		-[Core] Dynamic assembly compilation is suppressed when the debugger is attached to prevent problems
		 with certain configurations of Visual Studio. (work item 20904)


Version 2.5.1 (v2.5.1 RTM) 2014-04-06

	Bug fixes:
		-[Wcf] Components that were registered as PerWcfOperation were not disposed when the WCF called
		 ReleaseInstance on a different thread. There was also a memory leak related to this issue. This
		 has been fixed as well.
		-[Wcf] RegisterWcfServices class now registers a WCF service class as Singleton in case it is
		 marked with [ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode = InstanceContextMode.Single) and an exception is
		 thrown if it is marked with [ServiceBehavior(ConcurrencyMode = ConcurrencyMode.Multiple)], because
		 Simple Injector will be unable to handle that configuration without causing concurrency bugs.


Version 2.5.0 (v2.5 RTM) 2014-03-02

	General description:
		The most prominent new feature is the addition of async/await support. This is supported by the
		addition of a new ExecutionContextScoping package and the ExecutionContextScopeLifestyle. On top of 
		this is the new Web API integration package that allows registering instances with a 
		WebApiRequestLifestyle for both IIS-hosted and self-hosted Web API projects.

		Besides these, there are lots of small improvements and bug fixes in the core library, such as the
		ability to register a factory-factory delegate using the RegisterDecorator overloads, which allows
		creating new decorator types based on contextual information.


	New features:
		-[ExecutionContextScoping] New SimpleInjector.Extensions.ExecutionContextScoping project has been
		 added that allows defining a scope that flows through asynchronous operations. (work item 20738)
		-[WebApi] New SimpleInjector.Integration.WebApi project has been added that adds support for Web API.
		 (work item 20082)

	Improvements:
		-[Core] New RegisterDecorator overload added that allows supplying a factory delegate for creating
		 decorator types. (work item 20550)
		-[LifetimeScoping/Wcf] Removed the need to explicitly call EnableLifetimeScoping /
		 EnablePerWcfOperationLifestyle when no lifetime scoped instances are registered.
		-[Core] Design of the ScopedLifestyle class improved to make it easier to create custom lifestyles.
		-[Core/LifestyleScoping/Web/Wcf] Performance improvements for ScopeLifestyle derivatives. Resolving 
		 the scope is now done once per compiled delegate and resolving an scoped instance from that scope is 
		 also done just once per compiled delegate. (work item 20641)
		-[Core] A call to verify will now ensure deterministic disposal of the scoped instances that are
		 created during verification. (work item 20773)

	Bug fixes:
		-[Core] Concurrency bug fixed in collections registered with RegisterAllOpenGeneric. (work item 20681).
		-[Core] Scoped lifestyles now allow resolving new instances while they are being disposed. Those
		 resolved instances will be disposed as well.
		-[Core] Unregistered concrete types that were requested inside a singleton-registered delegate, were
		 instantiated twice during a call to Verify. (work item 20732).


Version 2.4.1 (v2.4.1 RTM) 2014-01-14

	General description:
		This patch release fixes a bug in the core library concerning registration of generic types. This
		release also includes improvements to the Verify method.

	Improvements:
		-[Core] Improved performance of calls to Verify() and lowered the memory consumption of the container
		 caused by a call to Verify(). (work item 20083)
		-[Core] Verify now only creates instances that are root objects. This prevents users from having to 
		 write special case when extending the framework with methods such as RegisterWithContext.

	Bug fixes:
		-[Core] Registering generic types using RegisterOpenGeneric and RegisterDecorator resulted in a
		 stack overflow exception in case the generic type contained a type constraint that referred back to
		 the type (a.k.a. Curiously Recurring Template Pattern). (work item 20602).
		-[Core/LifetimeScoping/Web/Wcf] Scoped lifestyles did not ensure that all instances where disposed.
		 (work item 20579)


Version 2.4.0 (v2.4.0 RTM) 2013-12-08

	General description:
		The big new feature in this minor release is the addition of a diagnostic API, which allows querying 
		the container for diagnostic information. Since version 2.0, Simple Injector has allowed developers to
		show diagnostic information while debugging. The new diagnostic API allows developers to request this 
		information programmatically. This allows writing integration tests that verify the correctness of the 
		container's configuration.

		Besides this, there are lots of small improvements and bug fixes in the core library, such as the 
		addition of the abstract ScopedLifestyle base class; the capability to resolve collections as 
		IReadOnlyCollection<T> and IReadOnlyList<T>, and the possibility to register partial open generic 
		types.

	New features:
		-[Core] Lifestyle.CreateProducer extension methods added to make creating InstanceProducer instances
		 more convenient. (work item 19959).
		-[Core/LifetimeScoping/Web/Wcf] An ScopedLifestyle abstraction is added and the scoped lifestyles for
		 lifetime scoping web and WCF. This allows the container registration to be oblivious to the actual
		 scoped lifestyle implementation. The ScopedLifestyle class adds an WhenScopeEnds an 
		 RegisterForDisposal method that users can interact with. (work item 19969)
		-[Core] New Lifestyle.CreateHybrid method overload added that accepts two ScopedLifestyle instances
		 and returns a hybrid ScopeLifestyle. (work item 19969)
		-[Core] RegisterAll(Type, params Registration[]) overload added to make registering collections using
		 Registration instances more convenient. (work item 20001)
		-[Core] New convenient Lifestyle.CreateRegistration overloads added that allow supplying a single 
		 TConcrete type instead of TService and TImplementation.
		-[Core] Registered collections can now be injected and resolved as IReadOnlyCollection<T> and
		 IReadOnlyList<T> (.NET 4.5 only). (work item 19992).
		-[Core] New RegisterOpenGeneric overloads have been added that allow passing on a predicate that
		 allows determining on a per-type basis whether the registered implementation should be applied.
		 (work item 20284).		
		-[Diagnostics] Created a public API for querying the container for diagnostic results (work item 20062).
		-[Core] New Container.RegisterInitializer overload added that allows supplying more information about
		 the context of the created instance (which Registration and InstanceProducer created the instance)
		 (work item 19824).
		-[Core] Container.Register<TConcrete>(Lifestyle) overload has been added. (Work item 20324).
		-[Core] InstanceProducer.GetRelationships() method added to allow analyzing a registration's 
		 dependencies (Work item 20235).
		-[Core] Allow registering partial open generic types (Work item 19926).

	Changes:
		-[Core] Diagnostics moved into a separate project.
		-[Core] The container now ensures that property dependencies are always created before the type in
		 which they are injected into. (work item 20100).

	Bug fixes:
		-[Core/LifetimeScoping/Web/Wcf] Instances were disposed in wrong order. (work item 20100)
		-[Core] Not all created registrations ended up in the debugger diagnostics view (work item 19954).
		-[Core] Visual Basic debugger now displays debug information. The experience still sucks for VB
		 developers, but at least they can view the information now. (work item 20271)
		-[Core] Exception messages often contained the text "No registration for type {0} could be found " 
		 even though the type was registered explicitly. (Work item 20272).
		-[Core] RegisterOpenGeneric could fail because it would try to apply an incompatible implementation,
		 because the generic type constraints weren't always validated correctly.
		-[Core] Registration of variant types with RegisterAll failed (Work item 20366).
		-[Core] In special cases where one of the registered types in a RegisterAll registration would be 
		 an abstract type (which points back to the container), the ExpressionBuilt event wasn't triggered
		 for this abstract type and a decorator for this abstraction would not be applied (only the decorator
		 for the collection type would be applied) (Work item 20367).
	
				
Version 2.3.5 (v2.3.5 RTM) 2013-09-02

	General description:
		This patch release fixes a minor bug the Integration.LifetimeScoping package and fixes versioning
		problems caused by release 2.3.4.

	Bug fixes:
		[LifetimeScoping] Making a registration using RegisterOpenGeneric and the lifetime scope lifestyle,
		without explicitly enabling lifetime scoping using EnableLifetimeScoping, led to a uninformative
		exception, hiding the real problem. (work item 20162).


Version 2.3.2 (v2.3.2 RTM) 2013-08-31

	General description:
		This patch release fixes a few minor bugs in the Core library and one in the MVC integration library.

	Bug fixes:
		-[Integration.Mvc] The SimpleInjectorDependencyResolver will now throw a descriptive exception when
		 an unregistered controller can't be created (for whatever reason) instead of allowing null to be
		 returned, since this causes MVC to throw a non-descriptive "Make sure that the controller has a 
		 parameterless public constructor" exception, hiding the real cause. (work item 20097).
		-[Core] Diagnostic Services incorrectly reported a 'potential lifetime mismatch' warning
		 when a singleton decorator depended on a Func<T> where T was the decorated type. (work item 20141)
		-[Core] Calls to GetRegistration did not throw an exception that was as expressive as call to
		 GetInstance. (work item 20155).
		-[Core] Improved the exception message when a decorator registration is done with a type that can not
		 be used as decorator. (work item 20047).
		
		
Version 2.3.1 (v2.3.1 RTM)  2013-07-12

	General description:
		This patch release fixes a few bugs in the WCF Integration packages and one bug in the LifetimeScoping
		package.

	Bug fixes:
		-[Integration.Wcf] Lifetime scope was not disposed when object graph construction failed. (work item 19948)
		-[Integration.Wcf] WCF Integration broke WS-Discovery. (work item 19960)
		-[Integration.Wcf] Instances where cached per service type instead of per registration. (work item 19947)
		-[Extensions.LifetimeScoping] Instances where cached per service type instead of per registration. 
		 (work item 19947)	 


Version 2.3.0 (v2.3 RTM)  2013-06-30

	General description:
		This minor release focuses on advanced and integration scenarios in the core library. Besides these 
		features, this release contains several bug fixes.

	New features:
		-[Core] RegisterManyForOpenGeneric overloads that take in an BatchRegistrationCallback and a list of
		 types now accept open generic types. Closed generic versions of the supplied open generic types will
		 be added to the list of implementations that is supplied to the BatchRegistrationCallback.
		 (work item 19745)
		-[Core] RegisterAllOpenGeneric method (and overloads). They do to collections what RegisterOpenGeneric
		 does to normal registrations. RegisterAllOpenGeneric allows registering a list of open generic types
		 which will be transformed to a list of matching closed generic types when a collection is requested.
		 (work item 19758)
		-[Core] New RegisterAll(Type, IEnumerable<Registration>) overload added to make registering collections
		 more consistent. (work item 19876)
		-[Core] A new AppendToCollection extension method has been added to the AdvancedExtensions class in
		 the SimpleInjector.Advanced namespace to make integration with frameworks such as NServiceBus and
		 ReactiveUI easier (work item 19771)

	Changes:
		-[Core] Func<T> decoratee dependencies in decorators are now verified when calling container.Verify() 
		 (work item 19851).
		-[Core] Registrations of collections are now generated and compiled more lazily which improves
		 performance when items are retrieved by index in large collections. (work item 19601)
		-[NuGet] Silverlight NuGet packages are now merged with .NET packages. The separate Silverlight
		 packages still exist, but will be deprecated soon. (work item 19764)

	Bug fixes:
		-[Core] Adding KnownRelationships during ExpressionBuilt would leak to other InstanceProducers when
		 they shared the same Registration. (work item 19796).
		-[Core] The RegisterDecorator method overload that accepts the predicate didn't supply the correct
		 DecoratorPredicateContext when decorating multiple registrations with the same service type. The
		 internal cached used the service type as key, not the InstanceProducer itself. (work item 19780).
		-[Core] The container did not check for possible cyclic dependencies while resolving collections,
		 which could cause a stack overflow exception. (work item 19849).
		-[Core] The framework shows user friendly (C# like) type names in exception messages, but this failed
		 when displaying a type that was a an array of generic types (example: Tuple<int>[]). In that case a 
		 FormatException was thrown (work item 19847).
		-[Core] Resolving an externally provided singleton (using RegisterSingle<TService>(TService)) failed
		 when the supplied instance was a subtype of TService and contained a property that was configured to
		 be injected. (work items 19880).
		-[Core] RegisterInitializer behaved inconsistent between singleton registrations with a delegate and
		 an instance. The instance would get the delegate applied, while the delegate didn't. (work item 19881).
		-[Integration.Wcf] For some WCF configurations, the container would throw an InvalidOperationException
		 with the message "WCF scopes can not be nested.". (work item 19866).


Version 2.2.3 (v2.2.3 RTM)  2013-05-05

	General description:
		Small performance improvement and bug fix concerning the use of ResolveUnregisteredType and
		RegisterOpenGeneric.

	Changes:
		-[Core] ResolveUnregisteredType event was triggered more often than needed, which had a negative
		 impact on performance.

	Bug fixes:
		-[Core] Use of ResolveUnregisteredType event (that is primarily consumed by the RegisterOpenGeneric
		 extension methods) could lead to incorrect 'Single Responsibility Violation' warnings in the
		 Debugger Diagnostic view. (work item 19670)


Version 2.2.1 (v2.2.1 RTM)  2013-04-19

	General description:
		This patch release fixes a few small bugs and and performance improvements. The performance of
		the initialization phase is improved and items of registered collections can now be retrieved with an
		O(1) characteristic.

	New features:
		-[Integration.Web.Mvc] SimpleInjectorMvcExtensions.GetControllerTypesToRegister method added. This
		 allows users to change the way MVC controllers are registered by default (using the
		 RegisterMvcControllers overload).

	Changes:
		-[Core] When a collection is registered using RegisterAll<T>(T[]), RegisterAll<T>(Type[]), 
		 RegisterAll<T>(IEnumerable<Type>) or RegisterAll(Type, IEnumerable<Type>), retrieving that instance
		 using the generic GetAllInstances<T>() will now return a collection that implements IList<T>. This
		 allows retrieving elements by index with an performance characteristic of O(1). Collections decorated
		 using the RegisterDecorator overloads will maintain this behavior. Note that this is not supported
		 when retrieving instances using GetAllInstances(Type). (work item 19575)
		-[Core] Each container instance now uses a single dynamic assembly for delegate compilation. This used
		 to be one generic assembly per compiled delegate, but this has much more overhead.
		 
	Bug fixes:
		-[Core] Registering a collection using RegisterAll<object>(Type[]) failed when one of the supplied
		 types was an interface incorrectly stating the interface did not inherit from Object. 
		 (work item 19577)
		-[Core] The RegisterAll<TService>(TService[]) overload that takes in an array of singleton instances,
		 did not let those instances go through the pipeline as would happen when registering a singleton
		 instance using Register<TService>(TService). With the latter method properties and possible other
		 transformations would be applied, while the former only called the initializer delegates.
		 (work item 19576)
		-[Core] Verify only checked the original registration of collections and not whether the final
		 collection (that could be intercepted and decorated) worked as expected. (work item 19596)


Version v2.2.0 (v2.2 RTM) 2013-04-08
	General description:
		Besides a few bug fixes, this minor release adds two features that enable some integration scenarios 
		where the container is not in control of the creation of types, but types still need to be wired up.

	New features:
		-[Core] InstanceProducer.Registration property added to allow accessing the InstanceProducer's
		 Registration.
		-[Core] Registration.InitializeInstance(object) method added to allow initializing instances that
		 can't be created by the container, but need to be initialized according to the container's
		 configuration. (work item 19502)

	Bug fixes:
		-[Core] Properties where not injected when a single instance was registered using RegisterSingle<T>(T),
		 although any initializers (registered through RegisterInitializer<T>(Action<T>) did fire. 
		 (work item 19513)
		-[Core] A NullReferenceException would be thrown by the container, when a Func<T> registration was
		 called that returned null combined with the injection of one or more properties on that given T.
		 (work item 19526)
		-[Core] The exception thrown by the container when one of the type's properties can't be resolved is
		 more expressive now, and describes the name of the property.
		-[Core] RegisterSingleOpenGeneric and RegisterOpenGeneric with custom lifestyle didn't work correctly 
		 when the registration was made with the same type for both the service and implementation type, 
		 making the container fall back to resolving a transient type. (work item 19570).


Version v2.1.0 (v2.1 RTM) 2013-03-19
	General description:
		This minor release adds two new features: A new extension point has been added that makes it 
		considerably easier to auto-wire properties; A new diagnostic warning has been added that searches the
		configuration for components with too many dependencies, because they can cause maintainability issues.
	
	New features:
		-[Core] IPropertySelectionBehavior interface added to allow users to override the default behavior
		 (which is to not inject any properties). The default behavior can be changed by replacing the
		 Container.Options.PropertySelectionBehavior property. (work item 19389)
		-[Core] New warning added in the Diagnostic Services to warn about classes with too many dependencies.
		 (work item 19428)

	Bug fixes:
		-[Core] Register<TService, TImplementation>(Lifestyle) did not verify whether TImplementation was a
		 constructible type (in the default configuration this means that it is concrete, has one constructor,
		 and no primitive constructor arguments). This resulted in a failure during when resolving the
		 instance, but this was later than needed. (work item 19464)


Version v2.0.2 (v2.0.2 RTM) 2013-03-10
	General description:
		This release fixes a bug with the Visual Studio Debug View.

	Bug fixes:
		-[Core] Diagnostic Services fail when grouping generic types that have a generic type constraint.
		 (work item 19449)


Version v2.0.1 (v2.0.1 RTM) 2013-02-28
	General description:
		This release fixes a few small bugs.

	Bug fixes:
		-[Core] Custom KnownDependency instances that where added during the interception (ExpressionBuilding)
		 of a decorator type (RegisterDecorator) where not added to the decorated registration. (work item 19391)
		-[Core] Decorating empty (unregistered) collections failed when the decorator had a lifestyle different
		 than transient or singleton. (work item 19400)
		-[Core] When RegisterManyForOpenGeneric registered implementations that implemented multiple closed
		 generic versions of the supplied generic interface, each closed-generic interface got its own
		 registration, which had the effect of still returning more than one instance of that implementation
		 within the registered lifestyle. (work item 19384).
		-[Integration.Wcf] The integration package just didn't work as expected.


Version v2.0.0 (v2.0 RTM) 2013-02-25
	General description:
		This major release adds explicit lifestyle support and Debugger Diagnostic Services to the Core
		library. The addition of explicit lifestyle support makes it easier to register types in any given
		lifestyle, and the Lifestyle.Hybrid makes it really easy to create a registration that mixes
		any number of lifestyles together. The Diagnostic Services help you to spot common configuration and
		programming mistakes such as lifestyle mismatches, and short circuited dependencies.

	New features:
		-[Core] Diagnostic Debug View added to give feedback on possible misconfigurations in the
		 container. See here for more information: https://simpleinjector.org/diagnostics
		-[Core] Lifestyle base class added for implementing custom lifestyle management. Default lifestyles
		 are Lifestyle.Transient and Lifestyle.Singleton and a Lifestyle.CreateHybrid() method to create
		 hybrid lifestyles and a Lifestyle.CreateCustom() method to create a lifestyle based on a name and
		 a supplied delegate. Other lifestyle classes are implemented in the integration and extension
		 libraries.
		-[Core] Register overloads added that take Lifestyle as argument.
		-[Core] ExpressionBuilding event added. The ExpressionBuilding event gets fired right after the
		 expression is built that creates a new instance, but before instance initializers and lifestyle
		 caching gets added to the expression.
		-[Core] AddRegistration(Type, Registration) method added to allow directly adding a registration.
		 This allows binding two or more service types to the same implementation.
		-[Integration.Web] WebRequestLifestyle has been added.
		-[Integration.Wcf] WcfOperationLifestyle has been added.
		-[Extensions.LifetimeScoping] LifetimeScopeLifestyle has been added.
		-[Core] RegisterManyForOpenGeneric overloads have been added that allow specifying a lifestyle.
		-[Core] RegisterOpenGeneric overloads have been added that allow specifying a lifestyle.
		-[Core] RegisterDecorator overloads have been added that allow specifying a lifestyle.

	Breaking changes:
		-[Core] Verify() now locks the container. New registrations can't be made after this point in time.
		-[Core] Registrations can't be overridden anymore after Verify() has been called. (work item 19193).
		-[Core] All Func<T> factory delegates registered using one of the Register overloads (such as
		 Register<T>(Func<T>) are now considered to return transient instances. Custom lifestyles should
		 applied by supplying a custom Lifestyle implementation.
		-[Core] Action<T> delegates registered using RegisterInitializer<T>(Action<T>) are now also applied
		 to Func<T> delegates registered using Register<T>(Func<T>) and RegisterSingle<T>(Func<T>) and to
		 instances registered using RegisterSingle<T>(T) and RegisterSingle(Type, object). Note that this 
		 could lead to inconsistent behavior or performance issues if the Func<T> delegate implements its
		 own caching/lifetime, since for Register<T>(Func<T>) the Action<T> will be applied on each resolve.
		 Instead of registering Func<T> delegates to implement custom lifestyle, derive from Lifestyle.
		-[Core] IInstanceProducer interface has been replaced with an InstanceProducer class.
		-[Core] ExpressionBuilt will not got called twice anymore. ExpressionBuilt got called two times
		 in case a type got registered using RegisterSingle<A, B>(). The new ExpressionBuilding event will
		 now handle the first call and will do this in a more reliable manner.
		-[Core] The Container.GetInitializer<TService>() method has been removed from the container. The
		 method cluttered the main API. The method is moved to the AdvancedExtensions class of the
		 SimpleInjector.Advanced namespace. It's an extension method now. (work item 18349).
		-[Core] The types System.Type and System.String are considered ambiguous and are now disallowed from
		 being registered directly. An exception is thrown.
		-[Integration.Web] The PerWebRequestInstanceCreator<TService> has been removed. The
		 WebRequestLifestyle can be used instead.
		-[Core] The old OpenGenericBatchRegistrationExtensions.GetTypesToRegister overloads have been marked 
		 obsolete. There are new overloads that take the Container as an argument.

	Changes:
		-[Extensions] Extensions library has been merged with core library. Extensions library is currently 
		 empty, but will still be used as NuGet package for backwards compatibility for existing users.
		-[Core] A call to GetCurrentRegistrations() will not lock the container anymore. This allows users
		 to use this method to query the container during registration.
		-[Core] RegisterManyForOpenGeneric and RegisterManySinglesForOpenGeneric extension methods now ignore 
		 any found decorator type. This makes it easier to have use batch registration while having 
		 non-generic decorators in the same project.

	Bug fixes:
		-[Core] RegisterDecorator wrapped singletons twice. This was caused by the ExpressionBuilt event
		 that was triggered twice for singletons. (work item 19110)
		-[Core] Memory leak when using decorators with while creating many Container instances. (work item 
		 19241)
		-[Core] RegisterOpenGeneric failed to resolve types that had a "where TOne : TTwo" type constraint.
		-[Extensions.LifetimeScoping] Registration order of RegisterDecorator and RegisterLifetimeScope
		 mattered for the lifetime op the decorator. (work item 19120)
		-[Integration.Web] Registration order of RegisterDecorator and RegisterPerWebRequest mattered for the 
		 lifetime op the decorator. (work item 19120)
		-[Integration.Wcf] Registration order of RegisterDecorator and RegisterPerWcfOperation mattered for 
		 the lifetime op the decorator. (work item 19120)


Version 1.next (not released yet)
	General description:

	Bug fixes:
		-[Extensions] RegisterDecorator extension methods did not check whether the registered decorator type
		 contained a constructor argument that the type implemented. This allowed registration of decorators
		 that could never be used. (work item 18956)
		-[Extensions.LifetimeScoping] Registrations made using RegisterLifetimeScope could be invalidated by
		 other RegisterLifetimeScope registrations in case AllowOverridingRegistrations was set to true and
		 Verify was called in between. (work item 19119)


Version 1.6.1 (v1.6.1 RTM) 2012-12-12
	General description:
		The integration packages that were targeted at .NET 4.0 were incorrectly targeted at .NET 4.5. This
		was caused by a misconfiguration in the build script. This made it impossible to use those packages
		when .NET 4.5 was not installed.


Version 1.6.0.12318 (v1.6.0 RTM) 2012-11-13
	General description:
		A few minor bug fixes have been made to the Core and Extensions project and the behaviors of the Per
		Web Request lifestyle (RegisterPerWebRequest/SimpleInjector.Integration.Web) and Per Lifetime Scope
		(RegisterLifetimeScope/SimpleInjector.Extensions.LifetimeScoping) have been changed. Both lifestyles
		now throw an exception when an instance is trying to be resolved outside their scope. For Per Web 
		Request this means that calling GetInstance when HttpContext.Current == null will fail, instead of
		returning a transient instance. For Per Lifetime Scope this means that calling GetInstance will fail
		when no scope is defined, instead of returning a singleton instance.
	
	Breaking changes:
		-[Extensions.LifetimeScoping] now throws an exception when a per-lifetime scoped instance is requested
		 outside the context of a Lifetime Scope. The previous released returned a singleton, but this would
		 easily lead to hard to track errors.
		-[Integration.Web] now throws an exception when a per-web-request scoped instance is requested outside
		 the context of a HTTP request (when HttpContext.Current is null). The previous release returned a
		 transient, but this would easily lead to hard to track errors.

	Code changes:
		-[Integration.Web] PerWebRequestInstanceCreator<TService> class made public to make it easier to make
		 open generic registrations with a per web request lifestyle.

	Bug fixes:
		-[Core] Building a friendly name for an exception message failed for types nested in a generic type.
		 The original error was lost.
		-[Core] Calling GetService(Type) and GetRegistration(Type) with type being typeof(IEnumerable<>) 
		 failed instead of returning null.
		-[Core] GetInstance(Type) threw a less expressive exception as GetInstance<TService>() when a type
		 could not be resolved. (work item 18542)
		-[Core] Injecting properties could fail under .NET 4.0 and up where class inherited from 
		 System.Windows.Forms.UserControl (work item 18909).
		-[Extensions] RegisterOpenGeneric allowed registering types that could never be resolved (for instance
		 because they had multiple constructors). An ArgumentException is now thrown during registration.
		-[Extensions] An implementation type registered using RegisterOpenGeneric that could not be resolved
		 (because for instance it has unregistered dependencies) caused a NullReferenceException.


Version 1.5.0.12199 (v1.5.0 RTM) 2012-07-17
	General description:
		An extension point is added to the core library, which allows developers to override the behavior of
		resolution and injection of constructors. For normal scenarios the use of the default behavior 
		(which only allows one single public constructor) is still advised. 
		
		Other great improvements are in the RegisterDecorator extension methods of the Extensions project. 
		The container now allows injecting a Func<ServiceType> into the decorator (besides injecting the 
		decorated service type), which enabled more advanced scenarios where creation of the decorated type 
		should be delayed (which is especially useful when defining decorators for asynchronous execution and
		lifetime scoping). New RegisterSingleDecorator extension methods have been added, which can improve 
		performance and are especially useful when using Func<ServiceType> decorators. Support to decorating 
		collections has been improved. In most situations the predicate will be called for each element in the
		collection.

	Code changes:
		-[Core] Extension points added in the form of ContainerOptions.ConstructorXXXBehavior, which allows 
		 developers to override the behavior of constructor resolution and injection. (work item 18097)
		-[Core] Container.Options property has been added, containing the container options.
		-[Extensions] RegisterDecorator extension methods now allow injecting Func<ServiceType> delegates. This
		 enables some interesting advanced scenarios where the creation of the decorated instance should be
		 delayed. (work item 18211)
		-[Extensions] RegisterSingleDecorator overloads added. These overloads are especially useful when
		 injecting Func<ServiceType> delegates into decorators.
		-[Extensions] When collections are registered using RegisterAll overloads that either take a list of
		 System.Type instances or a array of singletons (so not with RegisterAll<T>(IEnumerable<T>)), the
		 predicate supplied to RegisterDecorator will be called on each item in the collection, instead of
		 being called once for the complete collection. This allows individual items to be decorated while
		 skipping others.
		-[Extensions] The extension methods Register(this Container, Type service, Type implementation) and 
		 RegisterSingle(this Container, Type service, Type implementation) now allow supplying the same type
		 for service and implementation, which registers the type by itself. (work item 18234)
		-[Extensions] RegisterDecorator and RegisterSingleDecorator extension methods now throw an expressive
		 NotSupportedException when a closed generic service type with open generic decorator type is supplied.
		 The container cannot handle this scenario, but the user can simply swap the generic type from the
		 service type to the decorator to get this to work.

	Bug fixes:
		-[Core] Container did not self-register when created with Container(ContainerOptions) ctor.
		 (work item 18139)
		-[LifetimeScoping] Dispose was called multiple times on instances, for each time they were resolved.
		 (work item 18268)
		 -[Extensions] RegisterAll did not allow registering a service type that equaled the registered
		 service type, for instance container.RegisterAll<IService>(new[] { typeof(IService) }) failed.
		-[Extensions] Conditional decoration (using the Predicate<DecoratorPredicateContext>) fixed for
		 decorating items in collections. The predicate was not checked on collections.
		-[Extensions] The IEnumerable<ServiceType> was supplied to the Predicate<DecoratorPredicateContext>
		 through the ServiceType property, instead of the service type itself when decorating collections.


Version 1.4.2.12141 (v1.4.2 RTM) 2012-05-20
	Bug fixes:
		-There was a bug in the SimpleInjector.Extensions.LifetimeScoping.dll, which made it impossible to
		 register instances (with a different lifestyle than Lifetime Scope) for disposal, when no services
		 where registered with the Lifetime Scope lifestyle.


Version 1.4.2.12140 (v1.4.2 RTM) 2012-05-19
	General description:
		The extensions project now contains 'RegisterDecorator' extension methods that replace the old
		'RegisterOpenGenericDecorator' extension methods. The new methods allow registering both generic and
		non-generic decorators. Integration projects have been added to the solution, which should make it
		easier to integrate Simple Injector with ASP.NET.

	Project changes:
		-New projects that were added to the solution:
			+SimpleInjector.Integration.Web (.NET 4.0)
			 Adds extension methods for Per Web Request lifestyle. This assembly takes a dependency on 
			 .NET 4.0 to allow the needed HTTP Module to be auto registered on application start-up.
			+SimpleInjector.Integration.Web.WebForms (.NET 3.5)
			 Adds extension methods for registering Page and UserControl classes.
			+SimpleInjector.Integration.Web.Mvc (.NET 4.0)
			 Adds extension methods for adding the container as Dependency Resolver (MVC3 / .NET 4) and
			 registering all Controller classes.
			+SimpleInjector.Extensions.LifetimeScoping (.NET 4.0)
			 Adds extension methods for Lifetime Scope lifestyle. This functionality can not be placed in 
			 SimpleInjector.Extensions, because it has a dependency on .NET 4.0 (makes use of ThreadLocal<T>), 
			 while SimpleInjector.Extensions must stay compatible with .NET 3.5 (for now).
			+SimpleInjector.Packaging (.NET 3.5) allows bundling sets of related services and register them
			 together.

	Code Changes:
		-[Extensions] New DecoratorExtensions class added. This class replaces GenericDecoratorExtensions
		 and allows registering both generic and non-generic decorators and enables decorating collections
		 that are returned using GetAllInstances or are injected using IEnumerable<T> constructor arguments.

	Bug fixes:
		-[Extensions] RegisterManyForOpenGeneric extension method threw an exception which message contained
		 the .NET type instead of the 'friendly' type name, as the rest of the Simple Injector uses.
		-[Core] DebuggerDisplay for InstanceProducers did not work when running the VB debugger.


Version 1.4.1.12065 (v1.4.1 RTM) 2012-03-05
	General description:
		RegisterOpenGenericDecorator extension methods improved to allow registering non-generic decorator.

	Code changes:
		-[Extensions] GetTypesToRegister methods added to the OpenGenericBatchRegistrationExtensions class
		 which allows to customize the behavior.
		-[Extensions] RegisterOpenGenericDecorator extension methods now allow registering non-generic
		 implementations, as long as they implement the supplied open generic service type.

	Bug fixes:
		-None.


Version 1.4.0.12049 (v1.4.0 RTM) 2012-02-18
	General description:
		Container.GetInitializer<T> method added to the core library, and RegisterManyForOpenGeneric in
		extensions now execute initializers on decorators.

	Code changes:
		-[Core] The internal Container.GetInitializerFor<T> method has been made public and renamed to
		 GetInitializer<T>. This enables certain specialized scenarios. The main (external) consumer of
		 this method is the RegisterManyForOpenGeneric method of the Extensions project.
		-[Extensions] Decorators created using the RegisterManyForOpenGeneric extension methods now get
		 initialized with any registered initializers (if any).

	Bug fixes:
		-[Core] The exception message that was thrown in case the delegate of a type could not be compiled, 
		 incorrectly described the UnregisteredTypeEventArgs.Register method, which was confusing.


Version 1.3.1.11358 (v1.3.1 RTM) 2011-12-23
	General description:
		RegisterOpenGenericDecorator extension methods added to the SimpleInjector.Extensions project.

	Code Changes:
		-[Extensions] New RegisterManyForOpenGeneric overloads added.
		-[Extensions] RegisterOpenGenericDecorator extension methods have been added.


Version 1.3.0.11343 (v1.3 RTM) 2011-12-09
	General description:
		This release adds a few features and fixes two bugs in the core library. The most important new
		feature is the addition of a ExpresionBuilt event, which allows users to alter the way types are 
		created by the container. This enables scenarios as interception, context based injection, and 
		wrapping types with decorators.
			
	Code changes:
		-[Core] A new overload to the Container.GetRegistration() method has been added. This overload allows
		 users to signal whether the method should throw or return null (what the original overload does).
		 Since the GetRegistration is the only method in the system that both builds and returns
		 IInstanceProducers, it is very convenient when it can throw, because this makes some scenarios
		 using the ExpressionBuilt event much cleaner, with less code.
		-[Core] All exception messages now display the names of generic types in short C# notation. 
		 For instance, messages will now show a name such as IEnumerable<IComparable<Int32>> instead of the
		 unreadable System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1[System.IComparable`1[System.Int32]].
		-[Core] New constructor overload added to the Container allowing to change the behavior of the
		 container using the new ContainerOptions class. The only option currently supported is 
		 AllowOverridingRegistrations.
		-[Core] Container.ExpressionBuilt event added to enable interception scenarios.
		-[Core] InstanceProducers are now allowed to return types that can not be casted to the given service 
		 type. This allows them to be retrieved using the non-generic Container.GetInstance(Type) and is
		 useful for interception scenarios.
		-[Core] Large internal refactoring of the InstanceProducer model. A lot of duplicate code is removed.
	
	Bug Fixes:
		-[Core] InjectProperties and GetRegistration failed in certain circumstances. (work item 16930)
		-[Core] Calling the Verify method still resulted in a lock down of the container, when the registered
		 delegates called back into the container. This made it impossible to verify a partially configured
		 container.


Version 1.2.0.11273 (v1.2 RTM) 2011-09-30
	General description:
		This release fixes a few small bugs, adds the possibility to do property injection, improves 
		performance and the SimpleInjector.Extensions.dll is now available for Silverlight.

	Project changes:
		-The solution and projects are converted to Visual Studio 2010. The library is still compatible with
		 .NET 3.5 though.
		-New SimpleInjector.Extensions.Silverlight project was added (and supporting unit test project).
	
	Code changes:
		-[Extensions] Performance optimization in the RegisterOpenGeneric en RegisterSingleOpenGeneric 
		 extension methods. Types can now be resolved as quickly as types that are registered using 
		 container.Register<TService, TImplementation>() and container.RegisterSingle<T>(T), which are the
		 fasted type of registrations.
		-[Core] New UnregisteredTypeEventArgs.Register(Expression) method was added to allow improving
		 performance of unregistered type resolution scenarios. (work item 16641).
		-[Extensions] Register(Container, Type) method added to the NonGenericRegistrationsExtensions class
		 to allow registration of concrete transient types.
		-[Core] The Container now registers itself upon creation. This makes some integration scenarios 
		 easier.
		-[Core] A InjectProperties(object) method has been added to the Container. This method enables 
		 injecting public properties to a given type. By adding it to the core library the method can be 
		 optimized for performance and used in integration scenarios without the need for adding the 
		 Extensions.dll.
		-[Core] The 'Handled' property of the UnregisteredTypeEventArgs is made public. This enables some 
		 rare but interesting scenarios were users want to prevent an ActivationException from being thrown 
		 when multiple delegates respond to the same ResolveUnregisteredType event. Publication of the 
		 property allows users skip and continue when another delegate already registered that type.
	
	Bug fixes:
		-[Extensions] NonGenericRegistrationsExtensions.RegisterAll(Container, Type, params Type[]) method was
		 removed, because it was never picked by C# compiler when doing overload resolution.
		-[Core] FuncSingletonInstanceProducer<T> did not reset the CyclicDependencyValidator in case of an
		 exception, which causes the CyclicDependencyValidator to go of when that failing producer was called
		 multiple times, hiding the real cause of failure.
		-[Core] The TransientInstanceProducer<T> and FuncSingletonInstanceProducer<T> incorrectly called 
		 "lock (this)". This behavior was correct in v1.0 were those types were not publicly exposed, but 
		 since the IInstanceProducer interface has gone public in v1.1 this is now incorrect. We could now 
		 face deadlocks when users decide to take a lock (for what strange reason what so ever) on these 
		 instances.
		-[Core] Container.GetAllInstances<T> and Container.GetAllInstances(Type) did not trigger unregistered 
		 type resolution. (work item 16419).
		-[Extensions] The RegisterManyForOpenGeneric and RegisterManySinglesForOpenGeneric extension methods 
		 that take an IEnumerable<Assembly> or Assembly[] failed when a Anonymously Hosted DynamicMethods 
		 Assembly was supplied, which would typically happen when the method was called with 
		 'AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()'.
		-[Extensions] The methods RegisterOpenGeneric and RegisterSingleOpenGeneric extension methods did not 
		 take generic type constraints and generic type reordering into consideration. (work item 16053).
		-[Extensions] Due to a race condition, it was possible for the RegisterSingleOpenGeneric method to 
		 new up more instances of the same type.


Version 1.1.0.11142 (v1.1 RTM) 2011-05-22
	General description:
		This release fixes a small bug and adds a small feature to the core that allows the retrieval of
		IInstanceProvider types. The SimpleInjector.Extensions.dll builds upon this feature to improve 
		performance of the registrations made using the RegisterAll extension method. The extensions project
		also adds new RegisterManyForOpenGeneric that allow many more advanced scenarios.
	
	Code Changes:
		-RegisterSingle(Container, Type) method removed from NonGenericRegistrationsExtensions class in 
		 SimpleInjector.Extensions. Because of the C# overload resolution rules, the C# compiler never picked 
		 that method, but would always pick Container.RegisterSingle<Type>(Type), which would not yield the 
		 correct configuration. Removing this method is a breaking change of the SimpleInjector.Extensions 
		 library, but users will unlikely be affected by this.
		-Performance optimization for non-generic RegisterAll methods in Extensions library. The optimization
		 prevents the container.GetInstance method from being called on each service type in the collection,
		 but now directly calls into the IInstanceProducer interfaces.
		-Public Container.GetCurrentRegistrations() method added that returns a list of currently registered
		 IInstanceProducer instances. This allows visualizing the registered dependencies.
		-Public Container.GetRegistration(Type) method added 
		-IInstanceProducer has been made public to allow better performance optimizations in the Extensions
		 library and to give users the possibility see what types are registered.
		-New RegisterManyForOpenGeneric overloads added in the Extensions library that allow users to supply
		 a callback delegate that does the actual registration. This allows alternative scenarios such as 
		 registration of multiple implementations of a closed generic service type. (work item 15878).
		-The RegisterInitializer<T> method now allows multiple Action<T> delegates to be registered for a
		 single T. (work item 15842).

	Bug Fixes:
		-Container.GetService method failed on concrete unregistered types, that could not be resolved using
		 auto-wiring, such as System.String and System.Int32. (work item 15843).


Version 1.0.0.11115 (v1.0 RTM) 2011-04-26
	General description:
	    First release of the Simple Injector.
		
	Code Changes compared to the Simple Service Locator v1.0:
	    -Generic type constraint 'where T : class' added to the GetInstance<T> and GetAllInstances<T> methods.
	    -Register<TConcrete>() method added for better Silverlight support.
	    -Register<TConcrete>(Action<TConcrete>) and RegisterSingle<TConcrete>(Action<TConcrete>) methods
	     removed.
	    -RegisterInitializer<TService>(Action<TService>) method added.
	    -The SimpleServiceLocator class is renamed to Container.
	    -Extensions project is now a fully supported addition.
	    -Silverlight unit test project added.
	    -CSL Adapter project added: contains an adapter from the Simple Injector to the Common Service Locator.
	    -Dependency on the Common Service Locator removed.
	
	Bug Fixes:
	    -Silverlight support fixed. The container did not work properly in Silverlight.
	    -Performance problems with the IServiceProvider.GetService(Type) method solved.
